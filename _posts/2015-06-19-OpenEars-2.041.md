* Brings OpenEars up to the current version of the Sphinx tools
* Fixes slow searches that could result in RapidEars or OpenEars getting too large of a memory footprint
* Increases accuracy, particularly in combination with Rejecto (not necessary to update Rejecto)
* Fix for n-best scores not varying
* The scoring baseline has now changed in Sphinx so if you are using scores (but you should not be using scores) you will need to lower your own baselines to match
