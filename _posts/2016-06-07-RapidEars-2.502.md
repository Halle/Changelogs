This update adds RapidEars support for OpenEars' new debug methods for disabling the audio session's preferred sample rate, buffer size and channel numbers (in nearly all cases these methods will not be necessary or beneficial to app projects, but have been added to assist with some rare edge cases â€“ please do not use them unless you have been directly advised to in the forums). The new methods are documented in OpenEars' documentation of OEPocketsphinxController.

RapidEars 2.502 also has some internal changes for more consistency and logging during listening startup and is a recommended update even if the new audio session debug tools aren't relevant to your project. It requires OpenEars 2.502.
