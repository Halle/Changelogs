Easy install
All-C language modelling and 3x faster phonetic lookup fallback method for vastly faster dynamic language model generation
Language model generation is now tuned to creating contextual models from long sentences with improved recognition accuracy
Only runs with ios 4 and 5 since the only devices that need 3 can’t use OpenEars due to hardware shortcomings. This allows optimizations that make OpenEars faster.
ARC/LLVM compatible
General recognition accuracy is improved, recognition speed is much faster in release versions due to LLVM
Uses the latest .7 versions of all of the Sphinx libraries
Calibration takes half the time and is configurable as an OpenEarsConfig.h constant
Silence detection period is configurable programmatically
It should no longer be necessary to do anything special in order to use iOS media objects such as AVPlayer.
It is possible to set OpenEars to programmatically mix with background sounds such as iPod music, although this is not a default setting.
OpenEars no longer attempts to start Pocketsphinx on a device that has no audio input available
OpenEars now cleans dynamic language model arrays on input for problematic whitespace
JSGF now has better perception
Dynamic JSGF switching has been added
The AudioSessionManager is now only used internally, since it was the main cause of configuration difficulty for most developers. OpenEars now manages the audio session automagically. Don’t call AudioSessionManager directly any more, it’s no longer a developer-facing class of OpenEars.
