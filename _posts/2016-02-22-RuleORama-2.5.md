RuleORama is now compatible with all of the languages that OpenEars is compatible with. RuleORama also now has a “sentence mode” for very easily creating a grammar based on a single sentence that will be read out progressively, and it now has its own convenience method for obtaining the location of its generated grammars. Bitcode slice now available as a configurable add-on in the shop.
