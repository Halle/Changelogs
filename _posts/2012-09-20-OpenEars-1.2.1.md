* Adds an armv7s slice so it can be compiled for iOS6 and the iPhone 5. This unfortunately means that armv6 devices can no longer be supported with the same framework, so armv6 device support (everything before the iPhone 3GS) is now only available by use of the legacy framework available here.
* Fixes the issue in which utterances which started before suspending listening might still end up being processed by the engine after you resumed listening.
