* Many stability and reliability improvements during long periods of listening (also for RapidEars)
* New properties for checking if the listening loop was entered and if listening is suspended
* New properties and methods for checking whether the user gave mic permission
* FliteController now does not make any calls to the audio session if used on its own, removing an issue that could occasionally lead to app rejection in cases where the developer didnâ€™t set noAudioSessionOverrides to TRUE.
