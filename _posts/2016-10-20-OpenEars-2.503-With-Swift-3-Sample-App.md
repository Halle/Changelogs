* This is the same OpenEars version 2.503, however it now ships with a Swift 3 sample app containing all of the same functionality as the Objective-C sample app. This is the beginning of official Swift 3 support from the OpenEars project. As usual, the distribution can be downloaded at http://www.politepix.com/openears and the Swift 3 sample app can be found in the folder OpenEarsSampleAppSwift at the top level of the distribution.
