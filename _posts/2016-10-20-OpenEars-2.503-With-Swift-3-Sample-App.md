* This is the same OpenEars version 2.503, however it now ships with a Swift 3 sample app containing all of the same functionality as the Objective-C sample app. This is the beginning of official Swift 3 support from the OpenEars project. As usual, the distribution can be downloaded at <a href="http://www.politepix.com/openears">http://www.politepix.com/openears</a> and the Swift 3 sample app can be found in the folder OpenEarsSampleAppSwift at the top level of the distribution. There is a tutorial tool for Swift 3 projects at <a href="http://politepix.com/openearsswift-tutorial/">http://politepix.com/openearsswift-tutorial/</a>
