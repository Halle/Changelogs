A bugfix release fixing the following issues:

* OpenEarsEventsObserver was never receiving a delegate message when a language model was being changed (thanks to Aleksey for finding this bug)
* LanguageModelGenerator was not finding alternate pronunciations of a word (thanks to Sarinsukumar for finding this bug)
* AudioSessionManager will now correctly reset audio session settings that a media player object (such as an AVPlayer or MPMusicPlayerController among others) overrides if startAudioSession is run a second time afterwards. If a PocketsphinxController object is already instantiated and its loop has been started at the time that a media player object has overridden its audio session settings, after AudioSessionManager startAudioSession is run the second time, you _may_ also need to restart the listening loop if the media playerâ€™s audio session override gave PocketsphinxController an interruption signal that caused it to make a controlled exit from the listening loop.

I strongly recommend upgrading to this version immediately if you use dynamic language model generation since it will improve recognition across different accents.
