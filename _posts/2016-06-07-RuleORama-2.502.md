summary:    Optimizations to grammar generation time
categories: openears

This update contains optimizations for grammar generation that can lead to grammars generating anywhere from 10-50% faster. Note: it is now necessary to opt in to using alternate pronunciations in grammars rather than opting out, and this is accompanied by an API change. Please read the documentation or header in order to learn about this if it is very important for your project to create grammars using alternate pronunciations.
