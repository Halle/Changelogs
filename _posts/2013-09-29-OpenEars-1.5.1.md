* Fix for a case in which null hypotheses could be returned even when no requests for null hypothesis return were made, which could also decrease perceived recognition quality in the case that null hyps were returning at the same time as new speech instead of immediately returning to the top of the listening loop as expected. OpenEars will no longer attempt to run its documentation build script except on Politepixâ€™s local build server.
