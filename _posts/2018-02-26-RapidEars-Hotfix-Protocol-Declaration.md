In response to [this changed Xcode behavior](https://www.politepix.com/forums/topic/rapidearsdidreceivelivespeechhypothesis-not-firing/#post-1032229), a hotfix version of the RapidEars demo has been released. Since it is a breaking change and the linked workaround will give the same results, licensed frameworks with this fix will be rolled out in phases. If you are a licensed framework user and want to integrate the fixed version ASAP, just get in touch via the contact form and I will make sure you're in the first batch, thanks!
